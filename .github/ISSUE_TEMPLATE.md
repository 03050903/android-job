Before posting an issue, please check the following:

* Do you have a question? Please take a look at the [samples](https://github.com/evernote/android-job#usage) and read the [FAQ](FAQ.md) first.

* Does the library crash for you? Please provide the version of the library, a log, stacktrace and even better a sample.

* Do your jobs not run as expected or do you see another weird behavior? A full log is necessary. Also keep in mind how [Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html) works and [maintenance windows](https://speakerdeck.com/vrallev/scheduling-background-job-on-android-at-the-right-time-1?slide=59) can delay your job.
